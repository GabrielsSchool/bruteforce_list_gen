# **Brute-Force List Gen**

This program creates a list for Brute-forcing websites, the program can be used on programs like Callow, Burp, and Hashcat.


# What you need to get started
You will need Python 3 and a Brute-forcing program to get started.
That's all! 


## How to use this program on windows.
First, you need to download Brute-force List Gen. You can do this by 
downloading it from the github page. You can't use this program on an
online IDE, you have to use it on Bare Metal. This is because the program doesn't write to a text file, it logs in the console and most online IDEs will delete mass-logging.
After downloading the program, right-click on the main file and click "edit with IDLE". Please don't edit any of the code, just click run. You might have to wait a few hours for the list to generate, after it gets to the point where you want it to stop push the key combo "ctrl + c" to stop then copy all of your text and paste it into a text file. Then import the file into your Brute-forcing program.


## Help with the project
This program has only been used on windows, if you use the program on a different os please tell me all about it so I can add it to this Mark-Down file.
